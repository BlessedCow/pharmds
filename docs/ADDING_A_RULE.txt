RULE ADDITION TEMPLATE (PharmDS)

This template defines the required information when proposing or adding a new
interaction rule to PharmDS. Rules must be mechanistic, conservative, and
educational in scope.

--------------------------------------------------
RULE IDENTIFICATION
--------------------------------------------------

Rule ID:
(UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES, stable and descriptive)

Rule domain:
[ ] PK (pharmacokinetic)
[ ] PD (pharmacodynamic)

Short rule name:
(1-line human-readable description)

Educational summary:
(1–2 sentences describing the interaction in plain language)


--------------------------------------------------
MECHANISTIC BASIS
--------------------------------------------------

Primary mechanism:
(select exactly ONE)

[ ] CYP enzyme interaction
[ ] Transporter interaction
[ ] PD overlap / additive effect

Detailed mechanism explanation:
Explain *why* this interaction occurs biologically or pharmacologically.
Avoid outcome-based or predictive language.


--------------------------------------------------
PK-SPECIFIC DETAILS (if applicable)
--------------------------------------------------

Affected drug role:
[ ] Substrate
[ ] Prodrug
[ ] Active metabolite

Interacting drug role:
[ ] Inhibitor
[ ] Inducer

Enzyme(s) or transporter(s) involved:
(e.g., CYP3A4, CYP2D6, P-gp)

Strength modeling:
(weak / moderate / strong / unknown)

Notes on uncertainty or variability:
(e.g., dose dependence, conflicting sources)


--------------------------------------------------
PD-SPECIFIC DETAILS (if applicable)
--------------------------------------------------

PD domain:
(e.g., QT prolongation, sedation, bleeding, serotonergic effects)

Additive or synergistic?
[ ] Additive
[ ] Potentially synergistic
[ ] Uncertain (modeled conservatively)

Clinical relevance note:
Explain why overlapping effects matter, without giving clinical directives.


--------------------------------------------------
SEVERITY AND CLASSIFICATION
--------------------------------------------------

Severity:
[ ] info
[ ] caution
[ ] major
[ ] contraindicated

Rule class:
[ ] info
[ ] caution
[ ] adjust_monitor
[ ] avoid

Justification for severity and class:
Explain why this level was chosen and why higher or lower levels were not.


--------------------------------------------------
LOGIC AND SCOPE CONTROL
--------------------------------------------------

Trigger conditions:
(What must be true for this rule to fire?)

Explicit non-triggers:
(What *should not* cause this rule to fire?)

False-positive risks considered:
(List tempting scenarios this rule intentionally avoids)


--------------------------------------------------
TESTING REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------

Positive (golden) test(s):
- Drug pair:
- Expected rule_id:
- Why this pair is representative:

Negative test(s):
- Drug pair:
- Rule(s) that must NOT fire:
- Why this is a common false-positive trap:

Edge cases tested (if any):
(e.g., induction vs inhibition, weak vs strong effects)


--------------------------------------------------
REFERENCES (OPTIONAL BUT ENCOURAGED)
--------------------------------------------------

Sources consulted:
- FDA labeling
- Pharmacology texts
- Review articles
- Educational summaries

Notes on conflicting data:
(How ambiguity was handled conservatively)

CONTRIBUTOR ATTESTATION
--------------------------------------------------

[ ] This rule is mechanistic and educational
[ ] I avoided outcome-based or prescriptive language
[ ] I added at least one negative test
[ ] I considered alert fatigue and scope creep
